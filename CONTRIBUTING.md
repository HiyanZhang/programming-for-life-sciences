# Contributing to the Project

We greatly appreciate your contribution and we want to make it as smooth,
transparent and enjoyable as possible for you to contribute, be it via:

* Reporting bugs
* Suggesting changes
* Contributing code (or documentation)
* Take responsibility over the project as a co-maintainer

## How to contribute

We would kindly ask you to abide by our [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct] in
all interactions with the community when contributing to this project,
regardless of the type of contribution. We will not accept any offensive or
demeaning behavior towards others and will take any necessary steps to ensure
that everyone is treated with respect and dignity.

### Filing a bug report or suggesting a feature

Please use the project's [issue tracker][issue-tracker] to either file a bug
report or suggest a feature. But before opening an issue, please double check
that a similar/identical issue doesn't already exist.

In case of **bug reports**, please follow [these guidelines][bug-report] (or
similar) to make sure that you describe the problem well and in a way that
helps others to reproduce the issue.

In case of **feature requests**, please describe the problem and propose a
solution. Go into as much detail as you can and provide any additional
information, context etc.

### Contributing code

We use the [GitHub Flow][github-flow] to ease collaborative development and to
ensure that any code changes are duly reviewed before they are merged into the
codebase. Before adding any code though, please discuss your planned
contribution with us first by either joining a discussion on an open issue or
[submitting a feature request](#filing-a-bug-report-or-suggesting-a-feature).
We just want to make sure that your hard work will have the highest possible
change of being merged.

If you have identified an issue you would like to work on and discussed so
with a maintainer, please:

1. Note that any contributions you are making will be covered under the
   project's [license][license], so before starting to contribute, please make
   sure you are okay with that.
2. Fork the repo and create a feature branch off the default branch (`main`).
3. Implement your changes, tests and documentation updates, if applicable.
   Please follow the coding style you find, including the formatting of
   docstrings and the inclusion of type annotations _for all code_.
4. Push your changes and open a (draft/work-in-progress) pull request. While
   not a requirement, we would appreciate if you would follow the
   [Conventional Commits][conventional-commits] specification for describing
   your individual commits as well as the pull request title. Note though that
   maintainers reserve the right to rephrase the pull request title and/or
   commit messages, or choose to squash or cherry-pick multiple commits, in
   order to ensure a clean commit history.
5. Carefully go through the check list in the pull request template; if, and
   only if, you are able to check _all_ applicable boxes, please mark the
   pull request as "ready for review".
6. Respond to any questions arising during review (please give us a few days)
   and, ideally, implement requested changes - it's greatly appreciated!
